## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I'm a junior undergraduate student passionate about understanding Earth's dynamic processes through stable isotope geochemistry. My research interests focus on high-temperature systems, particularly volcanic processes and volatile behavior in magmatic environments.

Beyond the laboratory, I bridge science and art through visual storytellingâ€”creating graphical abstracts, scientific illustrations, and digital designs that make complex geochemical concepts accessible and beautiful.
